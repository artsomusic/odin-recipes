    <h1 class="cachorro">Description</h1>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2 class="cachorro">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="gostei"><li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat. </li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="cachorro">Steps</h2>
    <ol id="gostei">
<li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
<li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. 
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
<li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
<li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
<li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
    </ol>
